	<p>This course includes content for the Mobile CSP Curriculum  and an option to interact with other learners in an online discussion forum. All coursework should be completed by August 22, 2014.</p>
	
	<p>Successful completion of required assessments will be recorded, and records will be maintained by the College for 180 days after the conclusion of the workshop.</p>
	
	<p>Participants are expected to comply with the academic
	honesty policies of The College of St. Scholastica and Trinity
	College. It is expected that all assessments are to be
	completed by each participant independently except for
	collaborative work. The College policies relating to academic
	honesty, as specified in the Student Handbook, will be
	followed.</p>
	
	<p>Academic honesty and integrity are highly valued in our
	online community. Academic honesty directly concerns ethical
	behaviors which affect both the academic environment and the
	civic community. Academic dishonestly seriously violates the
	integrity of the academic enterprise and will not be tolerated
	at St. Scholastica. The full text of the CSS Academic Honesty
	Policy is found in
	the <a href="http://www.css.edu/Academics/Office-of-Academic-Affairs/Academic-Honesty-Policy.html"
	target="_blank">Student Handbook</a> online.</p>
	
	<p>Participants are also expected to comply with standards of
	our community and to demonstrate Internet etiquette in their
	interactions with others and their use of online
	resources. Failure to comply with these standards may result
	in removal from the course.</p>
	
	<p>Analytics data regarding participant interaction with
	course materials will be collected and analyzed in the
	aggregate.</p>
	
	<p>I understand that neither The College of St. Scholastica nor Trinity College will sell
	or share my contact information with outside parties, but may
	use it to provide information about other courses and degree
	programs.</p>
