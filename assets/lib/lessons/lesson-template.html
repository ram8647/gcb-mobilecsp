      <h2>Learning Activities</h2>

      <blockquote>
	<h3>Hook/Motivation</h3>
	<h4>Discussion (?? minutes)</h4>Ask students FILL-IN HERE ... Ask questions such as:
	<ul>
	  <li>QUESTION 1
	  <li>QUESTION 2
          <li>MORE QUESTIONS
	</ul>

	<h4>Formative assessment</h4> 

	Listen to student conversations to assess their progress on
	(<div class="hover lo" data-id="5.2.1">LEARNING OBJECTIVE 5.2.1</div> 
          and <div class="hover lo" data-id="5.4.1">LEARNING OBJECTIVE5.4.1</div>). Students
	should be able to [PARTICULARIZE THE RELEVANT LEARNING OBJECTIVES FOR THIS ACTIVITY.]

	<h4>Explanation</h4> 

	Explain to students WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN THIS LESSON AND WHY.

	<h3>Experiences and Exploration</h3>

	<h4>Tutorial (30 minutes)</h4> 

	Briefly review WORK FROM PREVIOUS LESSONS... Then have students
	complete the Paint Pot Tutorial. [<div class="hover ctp" data-id="2">P2</div>] 

        <p><b>Options</b>. 
        <li>Students may complete the tutorial
	independently using the video or written versions of the
	student lesson,
        <li> or you may choose to lead the class through
	either version of the tutorial as students work in pairs to
	complete each step. 

        <p>As they work, encourage students to focus
	on the event-driven programming used in the app. In
	particular, call students’ attention to the questions under
	Event Driven Programming, just after the directions to add the
	Wipe button. Encourage students to think through the events
	that will need to be handled by the app and discuss their
	thoughts with a partner before moving on in the
	tutorial. [<div style="color:green; display:inline"
	class="ctp" data-id="3">P3</div>]

	<h4>Discussion (5 minutes)</h4> 

	<li>Discuss the new elements introduced in THIS LESSON, INCLUDING ...

        <li>Have students describe each of these new elements in their own
	words. [<div class="hover ctp" data-id="4">P4</div>] 

        <li>Generate a class list of KEY CONCEPTS IN THIS LESSON.

        <li> Have students talk with partners about any aspects of the
	tutorial that they did not understand.


	<h3>Rethink, Reflect, and/or Revise </h3>

	<h4>Wrap up (5 minutes)</h4> 

	<li> Have students write a reflection in their Google portfolios,
	using the prompts given in the student
	materials. [<div class="hover ctp" data-id="1">P1</div>] 

        <li> If time permits, suggest that students also try the interactive
	exercises for this lesson.

      </blockquote>

      <h2>Assessment Opportunties</h2>

      <blockquote>
	You can examine students’ work on DETAILS OF THIS TUTORIAL LESSON,
	their reflection portfolio entries, and their performance on
	the interactive exercises to assess the progress on the
	following learning objectives. If students are able to do what
	is listed here, they are ready to move on to the next lesson.

	<h4>TUTORIAL (APP) LESSON</h4> 
	<li><div class="hover lo" data-id="1.2.1">Learning Objective 1.2.1</div> Students should be able to reproduce the functionality of the TUTORIAL APP on their own devices.</li>
	<li><div class="hover lo" data-id="5.5.1">Learning Objective 5.5.1</div> They should be able to use a number to define the radius of the paint dots.</li>


	<h4>Reflection entry in portfolio</h4>
	<li><div class="hover lo" data-id="5.5.1">Learning Objective 5.5.1</div> Students should be able to describe all of the events used in the Paint Pot app (Click, Touch, and Drag).</li>
	<li><div class="hover lo" data-id="5.2.1">Learning Objective 5.2.1</div> In particular, they should mention that Touch events are brief and involve one location on a touchscreen, while Drag events involve sustained contact while moving a finger across the screen. </li>

	<br><br><b>MORE SUPPORT</b> If students struggle to describe and differentiation among the events used in the Paint Pot app, consider having them [XXX].


	<h4>Interactive Exercises</h4>
	<li><div class="hover lo" data-id="5.5.1">Learning Objective 5.5.1</div> Students should be able to effectively use a setter block to complete exercises 4 and 5.</li>
