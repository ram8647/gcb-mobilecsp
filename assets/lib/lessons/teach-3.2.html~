      <h2>Learning Activities</h2>

      <blockquote>
	<h3>Hook/Motivation</h3>
	<h4>Discussion (5 minutes)</h4>Ask students if they have used the Snap Chat app before. Have a volunteer demonstrate how the app allows users to draw on the pictures. Then discuss as a class, or have students discuss in small groups, how the app might have been created. Ask questions such as:
	<ul>
	  <li>What events cause things to happen when you use this app? [Sample answers: touching the screen, dragging a finger across the screen.]</li>
	  <li>What happens when each event occurs? [Sample answer: Dots and lines of color appear on the picture.]</li>
	  <li>What components are on the user interface? [Sample answer:There is a picture. There is also a set of buttons.]</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Formative assessment</h4> 

	Listen to student conversations to assess their progresson
	(<div style="color:green; display:inline" class="lo"
	      data-id="5.2.1">5.2.1</div> and <div style="color:green;
							  display:inline" class="lo" data-id="5.4.1">5.4.1</div>). Students
	should be able to identify at least one event that drives the
	SnapChap app and make reasonable conjectures as to how events
	trigger things that happen on the screen.


	<h4>Explanation</h4> 

	Explain to students that in this lesson they will create an app that
	is similar to this part of SnapChat. However, this functionality is
	not new or unique to SnapChat; a paint program was one of the first
	programs developed to demonstrate the potential of personal computers.

	<h3>Experiences and Exploration</h3>

	<h4>Tutorial (30 minutes)</h4> 

	Briefly review the App Inventor environment. Then have students
	complete the Paint Pot Tutorial. [<div style="color:green; display:inline" class="ctp"
					       data-id="2">P2</div>] Students may complete the
	tutorial independently using the video or written versions of the
	student lesson, or you may choose to lead the class through either
	version of the tutorial as students work in pairs to complete each
	step. As they work, encourage students to focus on the event-driven
	programming used in the app. In particular, call students’ attention
	to the questions under Event Driven Programming, just after the
	directions to add the Wipe button. Encourage students to think through
	the events that will need to be handled by the app and discuss their
	thoughts with a partner before moving on in the tutorial. [<div style="color:green; display:inline" class="ctp"
									data-id="3">P3</div>]

	<h4>Discussion (5 minutes)</h4> 

	Discuss the new elements introduced in the Paint Pot tutorial:
	setter blocks, touch events, and drag events. Have a few students
	describe each of these new elements in their own
	words. [<div style="color:green; display:inline" class="ctp"
		     data-id="4">P4</div>] Generate a class list of the events that
	drive the app and how each event is handled. Have students talk
	with partners about any aspects of the tutorial that they did not
	understand.


	<h3>Rethink, Reflect, and/or Revise </h3>

	<h4>Wrap up (5 minutes)</h4> 

	Have students write a reflection in their Google portfolios, using
	the prompts given in the student materials. [<div style="color:green; display:inline" class="ctp"
							  data-id="1">P1</div>] If time permits,
	suggest that students also try the interactive exercises for this
	lesson.

      </blockquote>

      <h2>Assessment Opportunties</h2>

      <blockquote>
	You can examine students’ work on the Paint Pot app, their reflection
	portfolio entries, and their performance on the interactive exercises
	to assess the progress on the following learning objectives. If
	students are able to do what is listed here, they are ready to move on
	to the next lesson.

	<h4>Paint Pot App</h4> 
	<li><div class="hover lo" data-id="1.2.1">Learning Objective 1.2.1</div> Students should be able to reproduce the functionality of the Paint Pot app on their own devices.</li>
	<li><div class="hover lo" data-id="5.5.1">Learning Objective 5.5.1</div> They should be able to use a number to define the radius of the paint dots.</li>



	<h4>Reflection entry in portfolio</h4>
	<li><div class="hover lo" data-id="5.5.1">Learning Objective 5.5.1</div> Students should be able to describe all of the events used in the Paint Pot app (Click, Touch, and Drag).</li>
	<li><div class="hover lo" data-id="5.2.1">Learning Objective 5.2.1</div> In particular, they should mention that Touch events are brief and involve one location on a touchscreen, while Drag events involve sustained contact while moving a finger across the screen. </li>

	<br><br><b>MORE SUPPORT</b> If students struggle to describe and differentiation among the events used in the Paint Pot app, consider having them [XXX].


	<h4>Interactive Exercises</h4>
	<li><div class="hover lo" data-id="5.5.1">Learning Objective 5.5.1</div> Students should be able to effectively use a setter block to complete exercises 4 and 5.</li>
