<h2>Learning Activities</h2>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Hook/Motivation</h3>
  <h4>Lesson Starter (5 minutes)</h4>

  Ask students to think about how images are represented on
  computers. If no one mentions it, explain computers break down images
  into pixels, and that the term pixel is short for “picture element.”
  Discuss image representation with the class, being sure to cover the
  following points:

  <ul>
    <li>After breaking an image into pixels, computers use a
      variety of methods to represent each pixel or groups of
      pixels as numbers.
    <li>Numbers are translated to bits, which are stored and sent like any other data.
    <li>Other computers use the bits to reconstruct image.
    <li>Storing specific information about every single bit
      would be an enormous amount of data for an image. What are
      some ways a computer might store an image using less data?a
  </ul>

  <h3>Experiences and Exploration</h3>

  <h4>CS Unplugged Video (30 minutes)</h4> 

  <p>Have students watch this <a target="_blank"
				 href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaV2RuAJTjQ">CS
      Unplugged video</a> on image compression for a quick look at
    one way that images are represented and compressed.

    <blockquote>
      <div style="background-color:lightgrey">
        <h4>PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT</h4> Simple black-and-white
        images such as fax images, as well as color pictures, have a
        lot of repetition in them. To reduce amount of the data
        needed to store and transmit images, computer scientists use
        a variety of <a target="_blank"
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_compression"> image
	  compression</a> techniques. The technique demonstrated in
        the video and used in this lesson is known
        as <b><i>run-length encoding</i></b>,
        or <b><i>RLE</i></b>. In this technique, the picture is
        converted into numbers by recording the length of
        alternating white and black pixels. This technique is well
        suited to images that have a lot of repetition in them. For
        example, fax images often have large blocks of white
        (e.g. margins) or black pixels (e.g. a horizontal
        line). Color pictures also have a lot of repetition in
        them. In practice, programmers choose a compression
        technique to best suit the image he or she is transmitting.

        <p>From <i>CS Unplugged</i>: “If we didn't compress images
	  it would take much longer to transmit pictures and require much more
	  storage space. This would make it unfeasible to send faxes or put
	  photos on a web page. For example, fax images are generally compressed
	  to about a seventh of their original size, so without compression they
	  would take seven times as long to transmit!  Photographs and pictures
	  are often compressed to a tenth or even a hundredth of their original
	  size (using a different technique). This allows many more images to be
	  stored on a disk, and it means that viewing them over the web will
	  take a fraction of the time.”
      </div>
    </blockquote>

  <p>Ask students to explain to a partner how RLE works, and then
    have them check their understanding by completing the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://2-dot-ram8647.appspot.com/mobileCSP/unit?unit=22&lesson=34#exercises">interactive exercises</a> on the student site.

  <p><b>DIFFERENTIATION:</b> More Practice. To provide more practice
    with RLE, have students complete these <a target="_blank" 
					      href="http://csunplugged.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/unplugged-02-image_representation.pdf">CS Unplugged Worksheets</a> (pg. 17-18).

  <p><b>DIFFERENTIATION:</b> Enrichment. To extend students'
    understanding of RLE have them complete p. 19 of
    the <a target="_blank"
	   href="http://csunplugged.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/unplugged-02-image_representation.pdf">CS
      Unplugged Worksheets</a> (pg. 17-18).

    <h4>Lecture or Reading (15 minutes)</h4>

  <p>Present a more detailed explanation of run-length encoding,
    storing images on computers, and other image compression
    techniques. There are several ways you can present this information:

    <ul>
      <li> Have students watch the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sZgmw9ECCo">video</a> of
      the Mobile CSP version of the lecture
      <li> Use the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MmKmh7fJKCCfwGzA238VPXZYLkCZvIIUQZ9L-RIDEYQ/edit">slides</a>
      to give the lecture yourself.
      <li> Have students read the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q4NinpY_-BLSjh9RVO1bD4apZYs4W93WbpX_nbas1Ec/edit">text-based
      version</a> of the lesson.
    </ul>

  <p>If you are new to teaching Mobile CSP, we suggest starting by
    having students watch the video lecture. As you become more
    familiar with the lesson and its content, you may decide to use
    the slides to give the lecture on your own, or guide students
    through reading the text-based lesson.

    <blockquote>
	   <div style="background-color:lightgrey">
	     <h4>PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT</h4> 

	     <p>There are generally two types of image compression
	       techniques. Run-length encoding is
	       a <b><i>lossless</i></b> technique, which means that the
	       image is perfectly represented and no data are lost. It is
	       the technique used in <b><i>TIFF</i></b> images. It is
	       preferable for medical imaging, archival imaging, clip
	       art, comics, and other applications.

	     <p><i><b>Lossy compression</i></b> is not perfect. Some
	       data may be lost. <b><i>JPEG</i></b> is an example of
	       lossy compression. It is suitable for photographs and
	       other applications where the loss of some data would be
	       imperceptible.

	     <p>The <i><b>trade-off</b></i> is between storage required
	       for the image vs. fidelity or quality. If a lot of
	       compression is required -- perhaps because of transmission
	       requirements -- a lossy technique may be preferred.
	   </div>
	 </blockquote>

	 <h3>Other Possible Activities</h3>

	 <ol>
	   <li>
	     Have students take turns encoding messages in ASCII binary code 
	     that someone else could decode. Trade messages in class and decode each others.
	   </li>

	   <li>Web pages use the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to encode web pages. 
	     Point students to the WWW Consortium's  
	     <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colormixer.asp">color mixer app</a> 
	     and invite them to explore the different colors that are used in Web pages.  These
	     colors are using a 24-bit scheme.
	     Some problems to solve might be to figure out  the Hex code for pure red?  
	     pure green? pure blue?
	   </li>

	   <li>Have students research other <span class="yui-tag-span yui-tag" tag="span" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><i><b>image types</b></i></span> (e.g. 
	     <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format">GIF</a>, 
	     <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">PNG</a>, 
	     <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format">BMP</a>, 
	     <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF">TIFF</a>, etc.) 
	     and then share discuss what they discovered in class. Ask them to compare and contrast the data 
	     needed to  store information about the images. Include what type of compression is used. 
	   </li>

	   <li>Have students research and discuss the type of image format used by their 
	     digital camera or a smartphone or tablet, find out what image representation scheme 
	     it uses?  Question:  How come all images are not the same size?
	   </li>

	   <li>ASCII is one type of character code, but 128 characters is not enough for today’s computers, which 
	     can represent Chinese, Hindi, and scripts from many other languages.  Today’s computers use a 
	     system called Unicode, which has more than 100,000 different characters and covers more than 
	     100 different scripts (languages). Invite students to use this 
	       <a target="_blank" href="http://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/resources/unicodemaker.html">Unicode converter</a>
	       to convert these 
	       Chinese characters to their hexadecimal Unicode values:  åè.  Convert these 
	       Greek letters: οι.  Convert these Russian letters: Я ю.  

	   </p></li>
	 </ol>

	 <h3>Rethink, Reflect, and/or Revise</h3>

	 <h4>Portfolio Refection (15 minutes)</h4>

	 <p>Have students complete the first two questions of their
	 portfolio reflections in class and tell them to complete the last
         question for homework. 
	 <blockquote>
	   <ol>
	   <li>Decode this message by converting it from binary to ASCII:
	   1000001  1110000  1110000  0100000  1001001  1101110  1110110  1100101  1101110
	   1110100  1101111  1110010  0100000  1010010  1001111  1000011  1001011  1010011
	   0100001
	   <br>
	   You can use this chart to help you: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q4NinpY_-BLSjh9RVO1bD4apZYs4W93WbpX_nbas1Ec/edit#heading=h.6e2ngjbac86z">ASCII Conversion Chart</a>
	   </li>
	   <li>
	   Describe what it means to say that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">JPEG</a>
	   is  a lossy 
	   compression technique and  whether or not it affects the quality of camera pictures.
	   </li>
	   <li>Give a specific example of a binary sequence that can represent more 
	   than one type of data -- 
	   e.g., a number, a color, a character -- and describe how to interpret its 
	   different values. 
	   </li>

	   </ol>
	  </blockquote>

         <p>The last question could be discussed when they turn in
    their reflections and as preparation for the reading on electronic
    documents in the next lesson.

    <h2>Assessment Opportunties</h2>

    <blockquote>
     <p>You can examine students’ work on the interactive exercise and
     their reflection portfolio entries to assess their progress on
     the following learning objectives. If students are able to do
     what is listed here, they are ready to move on to the next
     lesson.

     <h3>Interactive exercises</h3>

      <li> <div class="hover lo" data-id="2.1.1">Learning Objective
	 2.1.1</div> Students should be able to use RLE to translate
	 the numbers to images of letters in exercises 1 and 2.

         <p><b>MORE SUPPORT: </b> If students are unable to
	 successfully complete the interactive exercises, consider
	 providing more practice via these CS Unplugged Worksheets
	 (pg. 17-18).


       <h3>Reflection entry in portfolio</h3> 

       <li> <div class="hover lo" data-id="2.1.1">Learning Objective
       2.1.1</div> Students should be able translate the binary in
       question 1 to ASCII to get the message “App Inventor ROCKS“.

       <li> <div class="hover lo" data-id="3.3.1"> Learning Objective
       3.3.1</div> They should, in question 2, be able to explain that
       JPEG compression is a lossy technique because some information
       is lost when this technique is used, but that these changes are
       not perceptible to the human eye and so do not lower the
       quality of the camera.

       <li> <div class="hover lo" data-id="2.1.2"> Learning Objective
       2.1.2</div> Finally, in question 3, they should be able to
       describe how a binary sequence would be interpreted as a color
       when used as part an image, as a letter when part of a text
       message, and so on.
