NOTE: I couldn't get this module to work.  The problem was that
I could not get the quizly module to include other properties besides
'name'.   So I switched to creating a Quizly component, which worked
fine, except for being integrated into GCB's scoring system.  Components
are defined in the /gcb folder.

To reinstate this module you would only have to add the following
lines to main.py:

  import modules.quizly.quizly
  ...
  modules.quizly.quizly.register_module().enable()
