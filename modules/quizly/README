This is now the main implementation for Quizly quizzes in GCB.  Then are
known as "ram8647: Quizly Exercises" in the GCB Lesson Editor.  The
extensions/quizly version of this still works but is not integrated
into GCB.  

Initially this followed the khanex implementation but no longer does so
extensively.  

Here's how it works.

* QuizlyExerciseTag(tags.BaseTag) -- implements Quizly as a tag. 
 
  render() -- the method used to display the Quizly quiz in GCB. As
    the quiz is loaded, a script is executed that adds a record for
    the quiz, including its name and instanceid, to windows.quizlies.  
    This is done for each quiz. 

    A second script defines the checkAnswer() function, which is
    invoked when the user clicks on Quizly's "Check Answer" button.
    This script adds the result of the quiz to its windows.quizlies
    record. And it invokes the gcbAudit() function in activity-generic.

    A third script runs to input the gcb-index.html into the iframe and
    setup the "Check Answer" button. 

  get_scheme() -- this method sets of the widget that is used in GCB to
    select a quiz from quizzes.json when creating a new quiz activity. 

Overridden Classes
==================
The following overrides add the quizly tag to classes needed for 
processing the POST request and for inputting whether the quiz
has been completed when its page is loaded. 

class QuizlyEventsRESTHandler(EventsRESTHandler):
    """Overrides the default EventsRESTHandler to add tag-quizly"""

    TAGS_THAT_TRIGGER_COMPONENT_COMPLETION.append('tag-quizly')

class QuizlyUnitLessonCompletionTracker(UnitLessonCompletionTracker):
    """Overrides the default  to add quizly to TRACKABLE list"""

    TRACKABLE_COMPONENTS.append('quizly')

Unused classes
==============

QuizlyExerciseRenderer -- couldn't figure out how to do this

Functions
=========
register_module()  this function is invoked by main.py.  It doesn't
  do much. 

Implementation
--------------
To include this module you would only have to add the following lines to main.py:

  import modules.quizly.quizly
  ...
  modules.quizly.quizly.register_module().enable()
